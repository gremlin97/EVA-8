## Goal

* Create a simplified and well organized folder/file structure to host the model, utils and main driver code files seperately and import it for use in the colab file.
* Created a custom-optimized fast Resnet Architecture inspired by the DAWN CIFAR-10 Benchmark winner. Achieve 90% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 with a low training time using OCP and augmentations via albumentations.
